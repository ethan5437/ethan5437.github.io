<b>Knowledge-Enriched Visual Storytelling (KG-Story)</b>
<small><br>
KG-Story, a three-stage framework that allows the story generation model to take advantage of external Knowledge Graphs to produce interesting stories. 
KG-Story distills a set of representative words from the input prompts, enriches the word set by using ex-ternal knowledge graphs, and finally generates stories based on the enriched word set.

<b>A ‘Sourceful’ Twist: Emoji Prediction Based on Sentiment, Hashtags and Application Source</b>
<small>
<br>
Hashtags and Application Sources like Android, etc. 
are two features which we found to be important yet underused in emoji prediction and Twitter sentiment analysis on the whole. 
To approach this shortcoming and to further understand emoji behavioral patterns, we propose amore balanced dataset by crawling additional Twitter data,
including timestamp, hashtags, andapplication source acting as additional attributes to the tweet.
