<p style="color:orange"><b>Hello :)</b></p>
I have recently graduated with a Master's degree from Penn State University ([WE ARE!!](https://www.psu.edu/)) with a major in Information Science and Technology.
During my year at Penn State, I was very honored to join [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html), supervised by [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html). Meanwhile, I was also actively working with [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica, supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). It has been a fantastic journey working with talented members from both labs, and I have learned many valuable research skills and experience. 
<br>
<br>
** Update: I'm now in the gap year between my Master's and Ph.D. degrees, and I'm looking for a summer research internship!! **
<br>
<br>
<b>Research Interest</b>
<br>
I am broadly interested in machine learning, primarily in (but not limited to) NLP, Vision-to-Langauge, and Computational Social Science. My past projects mainly focused on vision-to-language generation and evaluation, machine learning in mental health, and social media analysis. 
<br>

If you have any questions regarding my researches, jobs, or even hobbies!!! please do not hesitate to contact me!!! :)
