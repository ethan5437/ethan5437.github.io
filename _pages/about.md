I'm a second year Master's student in [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html) at Penn State University supervised by Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang. I'm also working as a research assistant in [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica supervised by Dr. Lun-Wei Ku.

My research interest spans machine learning and deep learning, mainly focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), knowledge graph, and time series prediction.
