<!--<p style="color:orange"><b>Hello</b></p> -->

<br>
I'm Chi-Yang Hsu. I go by "Ethan". 

<br>
I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in Information Science and Technology.
During my year at Penn State, I was fortunate to join [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html), supervised by [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html). Meanwhile, I was also working with [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica, supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). 
Recently, I also worked as a research intern at University of Washington with [Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://behavioral-data.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. Tim Althoff](http://timalthoff.de/). 
<br>

I've accepted the offer from UT Austin Ph.D. in Information Studies, and I am very exicted to be working with [Prof. Ying Ding](https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/) and [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu/) to explore NLP applications in healthcare!!

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
I am broadly interested in machine learning, primarily in (but not limited to) NLP, Vision-to-Language, and Computational Social Science. My past projects mainly focused on vision-to-language generation and evaluation, knowledge graph, machine learning in mental health, and social media analysis. 
If you have any questions regarding my prior research or job experience, please feel free to contact me.
