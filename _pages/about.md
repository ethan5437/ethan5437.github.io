I'm a Natural Language Processing(NLP)/Deep Learning Researcher, recently received a Master degree from Penn State University.
During my year in Penn State, I was honored to join [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html), supervised by [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html). I was also working as a research assistant in [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/).

My research interest spans machine learning and deep learning, mainly but not limited to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Vision-to-Langauge, and Computional Social Science.
