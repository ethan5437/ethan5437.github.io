<!--<p style="color:orange"><b>Hello</b></p> -->


I'm Chi-Yang Hsu, but you can call me Ethan. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Studies. My research is supervised by [Prof. Ying Ding](https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/), and I am an active member of the [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu/).

Before my Ph.D., I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Information Science and Technology from [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/). At Penn State in 2019, I had the opportunity to contribute to the [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html). Concurrently, I collaborated with the [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica, led by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/).

From 2021 to 2023, I expanded my research horizons as a research intern at the University of Washington within the [Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://behavioral-data.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. Tim Althoff](http://timalthoff.de/).

My research interests are broad yet focused, spanning machine learning, with a special focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Vision-to-Language, and Computational Social Science. I've dedicated my past projects to exploring vision-to-language generation and evaluation, developing knowledge graphs, applying machine learning to mental health, and analyzing social media.

In my spare time, I enjoy engaging in sports such as ping pong, badminton, and swimming.
