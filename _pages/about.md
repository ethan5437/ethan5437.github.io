Hello, I'm **Chi-Yang (Ethan) Hsu**, a second-year Ph.D. student in Information Studies at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: black;">University of Texas at Austin</a>.
Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/" style="color: black;">Prof. Matt Lease</a> in the 
<a href="https://ai.ischool.utexas.edu/" style="color: black;">Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Human-Centered Computing (AI&HCC), I focus on bridging the gap between complex AI systems and real-world applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Explainable AI (XAI), and Computational Social Science.

I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Information Science and Technology from <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" style="color: black;">Penn State University</a>. 
There, I contributed to the <a href="https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html" style="color: black;">CrowdAI Lab</a> with 
<a href="https://sites.psu.edu/kennethhuang/" style="color: black;">Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang</a>, working on vision-to-text generation and computational social science. At the same time, I collaborated with <a href="[https://www.utexas.edu/](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/)" style="color: black;"> Dr. Lun-Wei Ku </a> 
at Academia Sinica's <a href="https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io" style="color: black;">Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab </a> , exploring vision-to-text and knowledge graph.

From 2021 to 2023, I was a research intern at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: black;">[University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/)'s <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: black;">[Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://behavioral-data.github.io/) under <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: black;">[Prof. Tim Althoff](http://timalthoff.de/). My work involved leveraging social media data to understand human behavior and inform computational models.

In my projects, I've explored confidence estimation and vision-to-language generation and evaluation. My goal is to make AI technologies more transparent and accessible, enhancing their positive impact on society.
