Hello, I'm **Chi-Yang (Ethan) Hsu**, a second-year Ph.D. student in Information Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.

Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/" style="color: black;">Prof. Matt Lease</a> in the 
<a href="https://ai.ischool.utexas.edu/" style="color: black;">Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Human-Centered Computing (AI&HCC)</a>, I focus on bridging the gap between complex AI systems and real-world applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Explainable AI (XAI).

I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Information Science and Technology from <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" style="color: black;">Penn State University</a>. There, I contributed to the <a href="https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html" style="color: black;">CrowdAI Lab</a> with <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/kennethhuang/" style="color: black;">Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang</a>, working on vision-to-text generation and computational social science. At the same time, I collaborated with <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/" style="color: black;">Dr. Lun-Wei Ku</a> at Academia Sinica's <a href="https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io" style="color: black;">Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab</a>, exploring vision-to-text and knowledge graph.

From 2021 to 2023, I was a research intern at the University of Washington's <a href="https://behavioral-data.github.io/" style="color: black;">Behavioral Data Science Lab</a> under <a href="http://timalthoff.de/" style="color: black;">Prof. Tim Althoff</a>. My work involved assessing conversational data in the mental health domain.

In my my recent projects, I've explored confidence estimation for Large Langauge Models (LLMs). My goal is to make LLMs more actionable and accessible for users, enhancing their positive impact on society.
