Hello :),

I'm a Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Deep Learning Researcher, recently received a Master degree from Penn State University.
During my year in Penn State, I'm very honored to join [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html), supervised by [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html). Meawhile, I was also actively working with [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). It has been an amazing journey working with talented members from both labs, where I learned many valuable research skills and experience, and I have decided to move on to the next stage in academia. 

I'm now actively looking for PhD positions. My research interests are machine learning and data mining, mainly but not limited to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Vision-to-Langauge, and Computional Social Science. 

If you have any questions regarding my researches, jobs, or even hobbies!!! please do not hesitate to contact me!!! :)
