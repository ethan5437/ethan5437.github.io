<!--<p style="color:orange"><b>Hello</b></p> -->

<br>
Hi, I'm Chi-Yang (Ethan) Hsu. I usually go with just "Ethan". 

<br>
I have received a Master's degree at Penn State University ([WE ARE!!](https://www.psu.edu/)) in Information Science and Technology.
During my year at Penn State, I was fortunate to join [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html), supervised by [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html). Meanwhile, I was also actively working with [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica, supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). Recently, I've been working as a research intern at University of Washington with [Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://behavioral-data.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. Tim Althoff](http://timalthoff.de/).

<b>Research Interest</b>
<br>
I am broadly interested in machine learning, primarily in (but not limited to) NLP, Vision-to-Language, and Computational Social Science. My past projects mainly focused on vision-to-language generation and evaluation, knowledge graph, machine learning in mental health, and social media analysis. 
If you have any questions regarding my researches and jobs, please do not hesitate to contact me!
