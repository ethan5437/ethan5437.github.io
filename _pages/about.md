Hello, I'm **Chi-Yang (Ethan) Hsu**, a second-year Ph.D. student in Information Studies at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). Under the guidance of [Prof. Matt Lease](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/) in the [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Human-Centered Computing (AI&HCC)](https://ai.ischool.utexas.edu/), I focus on bridging the gap between complex AI systems and real-world applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Explainable AI (XAI), and Computational Social Science.

I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Information Science and Technology from [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/). There, I contributed to the [CrowdAI Lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/crowd-ai-lab.html) with [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://sites.psu.edu/kennethhuang/), working on vision-to-text generation and computational social science. At the same time, I collaborated with [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/) at Academia Sinica's [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io), exploring vision-to-text and knowledge graph.

From 2021 to 2023, I was a research intern at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/)'s [Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://behavioral-data.github.io/) under [Prof. Tim Althoff](http://timalthoff.de/). My work involved leveraging social media data to understand human behavior and inform computational models.

In my projects, I've explored confidence estimation and vision-to-language generation and evaluation. My goal is to make AI technologies more transparent and accessible, enhancing their positive impact on society.
